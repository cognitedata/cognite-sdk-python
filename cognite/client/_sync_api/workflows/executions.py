            version (str): Version of the workflow.
            input (dict | None): The input to the workflow execution. This will be available for tasks that have specified it as an input with the string "${workflow.input}" See tip below for more information.
            metadata (dict | None): Application specific metadata. Keys have a maximum length of 32 characters, values a maximum of 255, and there can be a maximum of 10 key-value pairs.
            client_credentials (ClientCredentials | None): Specific credentials that should be used to trigger the workflow execution. When passed will take precedence over the current credentials.
            nonce (str | None): The nonce to use to bind the session. If not provided, a new session will be created using the given 'client_credentials'. If this is not given, the current credentials will be used.

        Tip:
            The workflow input can be available in the workflow tasks. For example, if you have a Task with
            function parameters then you can specify it as follows

                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes import WorkflowTask, FunctionTaskParameters

                ...         data={"workflow_data": "${workflow.input}"}))

        Tip:
            You can create a session via the Sessions API, using the client.iam.session.create() method.
