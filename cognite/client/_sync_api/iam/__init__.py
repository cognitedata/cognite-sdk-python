        """
        Helper method to compare capabilities across two groups (of capabilities) to find which are missing from the first.

        Note:
            Capabilities that are no longer in use by the API will be ignored. These have names prefixed with `Legacy` and
            all inherit from the base class `LegacyCapability`. If you want to check for these, you must do so manually.

        Tip:
            If you just want to check against your existing capabilities, you may use the helper method
            ``client.iam.verify_capabilities`` instead.

        Args:
            existing_capabilities (ComparableCapability): List of existing capabilities.
            desired_capabilities (ComparableCapability): List of wanted capabilities to check against existing.
            project (str | None): If a ProjectCapability or ProjectCapabilityList is passed, we need to know which CDF project
                to pull capabilities from (existing might be from several). If project is not passed, and ProjectCapabilityList
                is used, it will be inferred from the AsyncCogniteClient used to call retrieve it via token/inspect.

        Returns:
            list[Capability]: A flattened list of the missing capabilities, meaning they each have exactly 1 action, 1 scope, 1 id etc.

        Examples:

            Ensure that a user's groups grant access to read- and write for assets in all scope,
            and events write, scoped to a specific dataset with id=123:

                >>> from cognite.client import CogniteClient
                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes.capabilities import AssetsAcl, EventsAcl
                >>> client = CogniteClient()

                ...     AssetsAcl(
                ...         actions=[AssetsAcl.Action.Read, AssetsAcl.Action.Write],
                ...         scope=AssetsAcl.Scope.All()),

                >>> if missing:
                ...     pass  # do something

            Capabilities can also be passed as dictionaries:

                >>> to_check = [
                ...     {'assetsAcl': {'actions': ['READ', 'WRITE'], 'scope': {'all': {}}}},

                ...     existing_capabilities=my_groups,
                ...     desired_capabilities=to_check)

            You may also load capabilities from a dict-representation directly into ACLs (access-control list)
            by using ``Capability.load``. This will also ensure that the capabilities are valid.

                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes.capabilities import Capability
