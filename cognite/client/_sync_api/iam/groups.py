        Args:

        Returns:
            Group | GroupList: The created group(s).

        Example:

            Create a group without any members:

                >>> from cognite.client import CogniteClient
                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes import GroupWrite
                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes.capabilities import AssetsAcl, EventsAcl
                >>> client = CogniteClient()
                >>> my_capabilities = [
                ...     AssetsAcl([AssetsAcl.Action.Read], AssetsAcl.Scope.All()),
                ...     EventsAcl([EventsAcl.Action.Write], EventsAcl.Scope.DataSet([123, 456]))]
                >>> my_group = GroupWrite(name="My Group", capabilities=my_capabilities)
                >>> res = client.iam.groups.create(my_group)

            Create a group whose members are managed externally (by your company's identity provider (IdP)).
            This is done by using the ``source_id`` field. If this is the same ID as a group in the IdP,
            a user in that group will implicitly be a part of this group as well.

                >>> grp = GroupWrite(
                ...     name="Externally managed group",
                ...     capabilities=my_capabilities,
                ...     source_id="b7c9a5a4...")
                >>> res = client.iam.groups.create(grp)

            Create a group whose members are managed internally by Cognite. This group may grant access through
            listing specific users or include them all. This is done by passing the ``members`` field, either a
            list of strings with the unique user identifiers or as the constant ``ALL_USER_ACCOUNTS``. To find the
            user identifiers, you may use the UserProfilesAPI: ``client.iam.user_profiles.list()``.

                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes import ALL_USER_ACCOUNTS
                >>> all_group = GroupWrite(
                ...     name="Everyone is welcome!",
                ...     capabilities=my_capabilities,
                ...     members=ALL_USER_ACCOUNTS,
                ... )
                >>> user_list_group = GroupWrite(
                ...     name="Specfic users only",
                ...     capabilities=my_capabilities,
                ...     members=["XRsSD1k3mTIKG", "M0SxY6bM9Jl"])
                >>> res = client.iam.groups.create([user_list_group, all_group])

            Capabilities are often defined in configuration files, like YAML or JSON. You may convert capabilities
            from a dict-representation directly into ACLs (access-control list) by using ``Capability.load``.
            This will also ensure that the capabilities are valid.

                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes.capabilities import Capability
                >>> unparsed_capabilities = [
                ...     {'assetsAcl': {'actions': ['READ', 'WRITE'], 'scope': {'all': {}}}},
                ...     {'eventsAcl': {'actions': ['WRITE'], 'scope': {'datasetScope': {'ids': [123]}}}},
                ... ]
                >>> acls = [Capability.load(cap) for cap in unparsed_capabilities]
                >>> group = GroupWrite(name="Another group", capabilities=acls)
