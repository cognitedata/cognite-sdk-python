        Iterate over sequences

            metadata (dict[str, str] | None): Filter out sequences that do not match these metadata fields and values (case-sensitive). Format is {"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}.
            asset_ids (typing.Sequence[int] | None): Filter out sequences that are not linked to any of these assets.
            asset_subtree_ids (int | typing.Sequence[int] | None): Only include sequences that have a related asset in a subtree rooted at any of these assetIds. If the total size of the given subtrees exceeds 100,000 assets, an error will be returned.
            asset_subtree_external_ids (str | SequenceNotStr[str] | None): Only include sequences that have a related asset in a subtree rooted at any of these assetExternalIds. If the total size of the given subtrees exceeds 100,000 assets, an error will be returned.

            last_updated_time (dict[str, Any] | None):  Range between two timestamps. Possible keys are `min` and `max`, with values given as time stamps in ms.
            limit (int | None): Max number of sequences to return. Defaults to return all items.
            advanced_filter (Filter | dict[str, Any] | None): Advanced filter query using the filter DSL (Domain Specific Language). It allows defining complex filtering expressions that combine simple operations, such as equals, prefix, exists, etc., using boolean operators and, or, and not.
            sort (SortSpec | list[SortSpec] | None): The criteria to sort by. Defaults to desc for `_score_` and asc for all other properties. Sort is not allowed if `partitions` is used.

            mode (Literal['replace_ignore_null', 'patch', 'replace']): How to update data when a non-update object is given (Sequence or -Write). If you use 'replace_ignore_null', only the fields you have set will be used to replace existing (default). Using 'replace' will additionally clear all the fields that are not specified by you. Last option, 'patch', will update only the fields you have set and for container-like fields such as metadata or labels, add the values to the existing. For more details, see :ref:`appendix-update`.

        Returns:
            Sequence | SequenceList: Updated sequences.

        Examples:

            Update a sequence that you have fetched. This will perform a full update of the sequences:

                >>> from cognite.client import CogniteClient, AsyncCogniteClient
                >>> client = CogniteClient()
                >>> # async_client = AsyncCogniteClient()  # another option

                >>> res.description = "New description"
                >>> res = client.sequences.update(res)

            Perform a partial update on a sequence, updating the description and adding a new field to metadata:

                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes import SequenceUpdate
                >>> my_update = SequenceUpdate(id=1).description.set("New description").metadata.add({"key": "value"})
                >>> res = client.sequences.update(my_update)

            **Updating column definitions**

            Currently, updating the column definitions of a sequence is only supported through partial update, using `add`, `remove` and `modify` methods on the `columns` property.

            Add a single new column:

                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes import SequenceUpdate, SequenceColumnWrite
                >>>
                >>> my_update = SequenceUpdate(id=1).columns.add(
                ...     SequenceColumnWrite(value_type ="STRING",external_id="user", description ="some description")
                ... )
                >>> res = client.sequences.update(my_update)

            Add multiple new columns:

                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes import SequenceUpdate, SequenceColumnWrite
                >>>
                >>> column_def = [
                ...     SequenceColumnWrite(value_type ="STRING",external_id="user", description ="some description"),
                ...     SequenceColumnWrite(value_type="DOUBLE", external_id="amount")
                ... ]
                >>> my_update = SequenceUpdate(id=1).columns.add(column_def)
                >>> res = client.sequences.update(my_update)

            Remove a single column:

                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes import SequenceUpdate
                >>>
                >>> my_update = SequenceUpdate(id=1).columns.remove("col_external_id1")
                >>> res = client.sequences.update(my_update)

            Remove multiple columns:

                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes import SequenceUpdate
                >>>
                >>> my_update = SequenceUpdate(id=1).columns.remove(["col_external_id1","col_external_id2"])
                >>> res = client.sequences.update(my_update)

            limit (int | None): Max number of sequences to return. Defaults to 25. Set to -1, float("inf") or None to return all items.
            partitions (int | None): Retrieve resources in parallel using this number of workers (values up to 10 allowed), limit must be set to `None` (or `-1`).
            advanced_filter (Filter | dict[str, Any] | None): Advanced filter query using the filter DSL (Domain Specific Language). It allows defining complex filtering expressions that combine simple operations, such as equals, prefix, exists, etc., using boolean operators and, or, and not. See examples below for usage.
            sort (SortSpec | list[SortSpec] | None): The criteria to sort by. Defaults to desc for `_score_` and asc for all other properties. Sort is not allowed if `partitions` is used.

        Returns:
            SequenceList: The requested sequences.

        .. note::
            When using `partitions`, there are few considerations to keep in mind:
                * `limit` has to be set to `None` (or `-1`).
                * API may reject requests if you specify more than 10 partitions. When Cognite enforces this behavior, the requests result in a 400 Bad Request status.
                * Partitions are done independently of sorting: there's no guarantee of the sort order between elements from different partitions. For this reason providing a `sort` parameter when using `partitions` is not allowed.


        Examples:

            List sequences:

                >>> from cognite.client import CogniteClient, AsyncCogniteClient
                >>> client = CogniteClient()
                >>> # async_client = AsyncCogniteClient()  # another option
                >>> res = client.sequences.list(limit=5)

            Iterate over sequences, one-by-one:

                >>> for seq in client.sequences():
                ...     seq  # do something with the sequence

            Iterate over chunks of sequences to reduce memory load:

                >>> for seq_list in client.sequences(chunk_size=2500):
                ...     seq_list # do something with the sequences

            Using advanced filter, find all sequences that have a metadata key 'timezone' starting with 'Europe',
            and sort by external id ascending:

                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes import filters
                >>> in_timezone = filters.Prefix(["metadata", "timezone"], "Europe")
                >>> res = client.sequences.list(advanced_filter=in_timezone, sort=("external_id", "asc"))

            Note that you can check the API documentation above to see which properties you can filter on
            with which filters.

            To make it easier to avoid spelling mistakes and easier to look up available properties
            for filtering and sorting, you can also use the `SequenceProperty` and `SortableSequenceProperty` Enums.

                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes import filters
                >>> from cognite.client.data_classes.sequences import SequenceProperty, SortableSequenceProperty
