            asset_subtree_external_ids (str | SequenceNotStr[str] | None): Only include files that have a related asset in a subtree rooted at any of these assetExternalIds. If the total size of the given subtrees exceeds 100,000 assets, an error will be returned.
            data_set_ids (int | Sequence[int] | None): Return only files in the specified data set(s) with this id / these ids.
            data_set_external_ids (str | SequenceNotStr[str] | None): Return only files in the specified data set(s) with this external id / these external ids.

            geo_location (GeoLocationFilter | None): Only include files matching the specified geographic relation.
            source (str | None): The source of this event.
            created_time (dict[str, Any] | TimestampRange | None):  Range between two timestamps. Possible keys are `min` and `max`, with values given as time stamps in ms.
            last_updated_time (dict[str, Any] | TimestampRange | None):  Range between two timestamps. Possible keys are `min` and `max`, with values given as time stamps in ms.

            uploaded_time (dict[str, Any] | TimestampRange | None): Range between two timestamps
            external_id_prefix (str | None): External Id provided by client. Should be unique within the project.

                >>> res = client.files.upload(my_file, name="my_file")

            If name is omitted, this method will use the name of the file (file.txt in the example above):

                >>> res = client.files.upload(my_file)

            You can also upload all files in a directory by setting path to the path of a directory
            (filenames will be automatically used for `name`):
