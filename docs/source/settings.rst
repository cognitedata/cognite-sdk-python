Settings
========
Client configuration
--------------------
You can pass configuration arguments directly to the :ref:`cognite_client:CogniteClient` constructor, for example
to configure the base url of your requests and additional headers. For a list of all configuration arguments,
see the :ref:`cognite_client:CogniteClient` class definition.

Global configuration
--------------------
You can set global configuration options like this:

.. code:: python

    from cognite.client import global_config, ClientConfig
    from cognite.client.credentials import Token
    global_config.default_client_config = ClientConfig(
        client_name="my-client", project="myproj", credentials=Token("verysecret")
    )
    global_config.disable_pypi_version_check = True
    global_config.disable_gzip = False
    global_config.disable_ssl = False
    global_config.max_retries = 10
    global_config.max_retry_backoff = 10
    global_config.max_connection_pool_size = 10
    global_config.status_forcelist = {429, 502, 503}

These must be set prior to instantiating a CogniteClient in order for them to take effect.

Concurrency and connection pooling
----------------------------------
This library does not expose API limits to the user. If your request exceeds API limits, the SDK splits your
request into chunks and performs the sub-requests in parallel. To control how many concurrent requests you send
to the API, you can either pass the :code:`max_workers` attribute when you instantiate the :ref:`cognite_client:CogniteClient` or set the :code:`max_workers` config option.

If you are working with multiple instances of :ref:`cognite_client:CogniteClient`, all instances will share the same connection pool.
If you have several instances, you can increase the max connection pool size to reuse connections if you are performing a large amount of concurrent requests.
You can increase the max connection pool size by setting the :code:`max_connection_pool_size` config option.
