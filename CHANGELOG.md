- Support for all endpoints in Cognite API
- Generator with hidden cursor for all resource types
- Concurrent writes for all resources
- Distribution of "core" sdk which does not depend on pandas and numpy
- Typehints for all methods
- Support for posting an entire asset hierarchy, resolving ref_id/parent_ref_id automatically

### Removed
- `experimental` client in order to ensure sdk stability.

- Renamed `stable` namespace to `api`
- Rewrote logic for concurrent reads of datapoints
- Renamed CogniteClient parameter `num_of_workers` to `max_workers`

## Fixed
- Bug causing `create_schedule` to yield 400 if description is not set

## [0.13.3] - 2019-03-25
### Fixed
- Make `upload_artifacts_from_directory` work on Windows

## [0.13.1] - 2019-03-14
### Fixed
- Make `_get_model_py_files` work on Windows

## [0.13.0] - 2019-03-12
### Added
- New client for modelhosting API: `experimental.model_hosting`
- Support for thread-local credentials
- CHANGELOG.md :)
- Enable toggling gzip with environment variable "COGNITE_DISABLE_GZIP"

### Removed
- `data_transfer_service` module. Replaced with separate PyPi package. 
- `experimental.analytics` client

### Changed
- Move all modules under `cognite.client` namespace so that we can have other 
packages under `cognite` namespace. This means `CogniteClient` no longer can be 
imported directly from `cognite` namespace.
- Move all autopaging functionality to common method on ApiClient class.
- `path` parameter in `client.assets.get_assets()` and `client.time_series.get_time_series()` is now `List[int]` instead of `str`
- Use shared requests session instead of one per client

### Fixed
- get_datapoints and get_datapoints_frame no longer cap time series data in certain edge cases.
- cognite-logger dependency is locked to 0.4.* to avoid breaking on minor updates.

## [0.12.4] - 2019-01-09
### Added
- Support for testing against py35, py36, and py37 with tox

## [0.12.0] - 2019-01-03
### Added
- Support for making raw http calls through `CogniteClient`
- Pretty prints for all response classes

### Changed
- Client interface. Methods are now accessed through `CogniteClient` class. * Ensures 
thread-safety. All sub clients (specific to APIs, e.g. files, events, timeseries, datapoints) 
inherit from APIClient class which give them access to sending requests through _self_.
- Documentation improved and includes examples for most methods.
- `DataTransferService`updated to use `CogniteClient`
- Api version no longer exposed to user.  0.5 is default and some 0.6 features are exposed 
through an **experimental** sub client.

### Removed
- to_ndarray() method on response objects.
