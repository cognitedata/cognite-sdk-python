  asset = Asset(name="my_pump", labels=[Label(external_id="PUMP")])
  client.assets.create(assets)

  # filter assets by labels
  my_label_filter = LabelFilter(contains_all=["PUMP", "VERIFIED"])
  asset_list = client.assets.list(labels=my_label_filter)

- `end` parameter of sequence.data retrieval and range delete accepts -1 to indicate last index of sequence.

### Changed
- Output in jupyter notebooks is now pandas-like by default, instead of outputting long json strings.

### Fixed
- id parameters and timestamps now accept any integer type including numpy.int64, so values from dataframes can be passed directly.
- Compatibility fix for renaming of sequences cursor and start/end parameters in the API.

## [1.1.1] - 2019-08-23
### Added
- `complete` parameter on `datapoints.retrieve_dataframe`, used for forward-filling/interpolating intervals with missing data.
- `include_aggregate_names` option on `datapoints.retrieve_dataframe` and `DatapointsList.to_pandas`, used for removing the `|<aggregate-name>` postfix on dataframe column headers.
- datapoints.retrieve_dataframe_dict function, which returns {aggregate:dataframe} without adding aggregate names to columns

### Fixed
- Sequences queries are now retried if safe
- .update() in all APIs now accept a subclass of CogniteResourceList as input
- Sequences datapoint retrieval updated to use the new cursor feature in the API
- Json serializiation in `__str__()` of base data classes. Now handles Decimal and Number objects.
- Now possible to create asset hierarchy using parent external id when the parent is not part of the batch being inserted.
- `name` parameter of files.upload_bytes is now required, so as not to raise an exception in the underlying API.

### Changed
- Sequences data retrieval now returns a SequenceData object.
- Sequences insert takes its parameters row data first, and no longer requires columns to be passed.
- Sequences insert now accepts tuples and raw-style data input.
- Sequences create now clears invalid fields such as 'id' in columns specification, so sequences can more easily re-use existing specifications.
- Sequence data function now require column_ids or column_external_ids to be explicitly set, rather than both being passed through a single columns field

## [1.0.3] - 2019-07-26
### Fixed
- Renamed Model.schedule_data_spec to Model.data_spec so the field from the API will be included on the object.
- Handling edge case in Sequences pagination when last datapoint retrieved is at requested end
